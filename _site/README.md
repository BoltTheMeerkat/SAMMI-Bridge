## Transmitter Collaboration

Transmitter is generated by Jekyll. Each section is a separate file generated from `_includes` folder. If you wish to propose changes, please do so by editing these files.
Any changes will immediately reflect at https://christinna9031.github.io/LioranBoard-Transmitter/tsl_transmitter.html. I also manually generate the Transmitter file for each release, which can be found in `_site` folder.
